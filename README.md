# SPACE INVADERS

## THE BASICS

Welcome to Space Invaders! In this project we decided to re-vamp on of our favorite video games using python. In this shooter game you must effetively navigate your spaceship and shoot lasers to destroy the aliens, while also being mindful of the lasers they shoot back. We hope you enjoy playing it and hope to see you on the high-score podium!

## INSTRUCTIONS

To run the game, you must make sure you are in the directory of this repository in your terminal window. Once you are in there, you can run the game by typing 'python lib/game.py'

This should prompt another window to pop up which will act as the screen/interface of the game. The first prompt, as displayed, invites the player to enter their name by pressing space. The field to input your name will pop up in your terminal. Simply type your username out and hit enter on your keyboard.

This will prompt the game window to update to the homescreen of the game. Once you have clicked back into that window, all you need to do is click anywhere on the screen and you'll be on your way!

Basic Commands:

    - to move your player use the <left> and <right> arrows

    - to shoot your lasers and destroy aliens use your <space-bar> key

On the screen you will see a multitude of aliens which will be one of three colors: red, blue, and green. You will gain points by destroying aliens with your laser shots. These aliens all have different score values associated with them:

Alien Score Values:

    - Red --> 10 Points

    - Blue --> 20 Points

    - Green --> 50 Points

In the event you get hit by an alien laser, you will lose one of your THREE(3) allotted lives. Your lives are displayed in the top right corner of the screen as hearts. If you don't see any more hearts in the top right corner, be careful because that means you are on your last life!

Assuming you survive past the first screenful of aliens, they will now they have met a worhty opponent and will regenerate with reinforcements in the form of an added column's worth of enemy space crafts. 

If you are a true space invaders pro, and make it to the point of having to fight 12 columns worths of aliens, the aliens begin to shoot even faster. 

Once you meet your extra-terrestrial demise, you will be shown the Game Over screen, which also displays the names and high-scores of other players who have played. 

After you have admired your own name and score, which surely find themselves atop the podium, be sure to exit out of the window so your score can be saved in our database.
